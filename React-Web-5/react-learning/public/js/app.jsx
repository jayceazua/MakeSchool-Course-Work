/*
Props is a way to pass data into a component when you first start it.


A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times
(Button, Panel, Avatar),
or is complex enough on its own
(App, FeedStory, Comment),
it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.

>> A component must never modify its own props.! <<

>> These are called "pure" function:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

>> Impure function
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  acount.total -= amount;
}

Strict Rule of React:
 >> All React components must act like pure functions
    with respect to their props.

State -  allows React components to change their output over
time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else,
without violating this rule.

  // >> Set up a timer whenever Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time.
  //>> lifecycle hooks

State is similar to props, but it is private
and fully controled by the component

Local State is a feature available only to classes.

/* NOTES:

Separation of Concerns:
 - Reducing couping, increase cohesion.
    >> Couping: the degree to which each program module
                relies on each of the other modules
   >> Cohesion: the degree to which elements of a modules
                belong together.
 - Eliminates cascading changes.
 - Reliance on primitive adstractions

React Components:
 >> A highly cohesive building block for UIs
    loosely coupled with other components.
 >> Use components for Separation of Concerns.
 >> Components are reusable, composable, units.
Keep your components small.

When the data changes, React re-renders the entire component.


JSX represents objects >> babel complies JSX down to React.createElment() calls

React Elements are immutable: you can't change it's children or attributes.
Only updates what is necessary.

ReactDOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and
only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired "state".

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes
jsx attributes to this component as a single object aka props.

Components can refer to other Components in their output.

>> Extracting Components <<
Do not be afraid to split components into smaller Components.
