2. Complied Languages are machine code which is render faster than an interpreted language. One of the advantages of a complied language is that they are render way faster than interpreted languages. Lower level languages like C, and C++ are considered complied languages. You have more control over hard like memory and CPU usage. Disadvantage of this that  you will need to compile the code yourself. Interpreted languages is higher level languages like Python, Java, Javscript to name a few. The obvious weakness is that interpreted languages are slower in rendering. If given a task to program a frontend interface of a program I would suggest using an interpreted language. Complied languages would be used in more systems administration environment where a POS needs configuring, or server rooms.

3. An algorithm is simply a set of step-by-step instructions for an outcome. Example: {insert number here} + 1 = outcome  {3} + 1 = 4. any number given will always be adding a 1. This is a simple algorithm. 


Problem 8.
Im not that good in python yet. but a list I believe it is a list of numbers... As Arrays are similar to as arrays in javascript.

11. Inheritance is a Object Orientent Programming concept where the programmer has reusable code to later use to create more instances of the class. For example on problem 10 I create a object constructor where the programmer can use my code to manufacture more cars instead of having to create a new object each time my code creates instances and it will inherit the prototypes and attributes for it.
